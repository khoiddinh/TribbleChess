# Tribble Chess

Tribble Chess is a custom chess engine written entirely in Java. It includes both the backend move generation and AI engine (located in src/engine), and a GUI which uses Java Swing. This GUI is runnable by running Main.java located in the src folder.

The AI is implemented with a negamax alpha-beta pruning algorithm.
